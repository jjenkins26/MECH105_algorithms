This algorithm performs a linear regression on a set of roughly linear data.
It's equipped to remove outliers more than 1.5 standard deviations above the
mean. It outputs a line of best fit based on the normal equations used in
statistical analysis of datasets.

linearRegression Computes the linear regression of a data set
   Compute the linear regression based on inputs:
     1. x: x-values for our data set
     2. y: y-values for our data set

   Outputs:
     1. fX: x-values with outliers removed
     2. fY: y-values with outliers removed
     3. slope: slope from the linear regression y=mx+b
     4. intercept: intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b
     5. Rsquared: R^2, a.k.a. coefficient of determination
