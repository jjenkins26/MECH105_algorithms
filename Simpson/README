This is an algorithm that implements the Composite Simpson's 1/3
method to approximate the integral given by a finite set of n 
points. If the set of points is even (n is odd) then it uses the
trapezoidal over the remaining interval.

 Inputs
   x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
   y = the vector of function values with respect to x
 Outputs.
   I = the numerical integral calculated.
